<h2>About Dontprint</h2>

<a class="anchor" id="q-about-dontprint"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-about-dontprint" href="#">What is Dontprint?</a>
<div class="answer">
Dontprint is a free add-on for the Mozilla Firefox web browser.
It is a small piece of software that you can easily install to augment the functionality of your web browser.
<p>
Dontprint makes it easy to send PDF documents, such as scientific articles, in an optimized layout to your e-reader device.
With Dontprint, sending scientific articles to your e-reader is even <strong>easier than printing</strong> them on a traditional printer.
When you come accross the web page of a scientific article from any mayor publisher a Dontprint icon (<img src="../favicon.png" width="16" height="16" alt="Donptint icon">) will appear in the address bar.
With a single click on that icon, Dontprint downloads the PDF file of the article, reformats it so that you can read it comfortably on the e-book reader's smaller screen, and sends it to your device.
<p>
For a full demonstration of Dontprint's features, go to the <a href="../features/index.html">feature tour</a>.
</div>

<a class="anchor" id="q-about-audience"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-about-audience" href="#">Who would want to use Dontprint?</a>
<div class="answer">
Dontprint may be useful to you if you own an e-reader device and if you sometimes read PDF documents on the web.
<p>
<strong>If you are a scientist</strong> and read a lot of articles from scientific journals then Dontprint is exactly right for you.
Dontprint knows how to interpret the websites of many popular scientific journals and preprint servers.
When you browse to a web page that represents a scientific article a small Dontprint icon (<img src="../favicon.png" width="16" height="16" alt="Dontprint icon">) will appear in the address bar.
When you click this icon Dontprint will download the PDF document of the article, optimize the layout so that you can read the article comfortably on a small screen and then send the article to your e-reader.
The layout optimizer even knows how to handle multi-column articles with figures and complicated equations.
<p>
Dontprint may also be useful to you <strong>if you are not a scientist</strong> but you sometimes come accross PDF documents which you would like to read on your e-reader.
You can use Dontprint with any PDF document that's either on your computer or that you come accross on the web.
The optimization of the layout for a small e-reader screen works best for PDF documents that contain mainly text.
</div>

<a class="anchor" id="q-about-differenceemail"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-about-differenceemail" href="#">I can already send PDF Documents to my e-reader by e-mail. What does Dontprint bring to the table?</a>
<div class="answer">
Most scientific articles are layouted in a form that is appealing to read in a printed journal.
Unforunately, these documents are usually almost unreadable on a small e-reader screen.
Dontprint solves this problem for you.
When you send an article to your e-reader, Dontprint rearranges the text flow so that you can read the article comfortably on your e-reader.
This works great even with articles that have <strong>several columns</strong> and contain <strong>complicated equations</strong> or <strong>figures</strong>.
<p>
In addition to the layout optimizations, using Dontprint is <strong>much simpler</strong> than sending articles manually by e-mail to your e-reader.
Without Dontprint, you would have to download an article, switch to your e-mail application, compose a new message, add an attachment, locate the downloaded article in your file-system and finally send the message.
If you install Dontprint, it will add a small icon (<img src="../favicon.png" width="16" height="16" alt="Dontprint icon">) to your web-browser's address bar whenever you're reading the abstract of some article from a scientific journal or a preprint server.
Just click that icon and the article will automatically be downloaded, converted, and sent to your e-reader.
That's even easier than printing on a traditional printer!
Of course, you can also use Dontprint to send PDF documents that are already stored on your computer.
<p>
In case you're interested in the details: Dontprint internally uses a third-party tool called "<a href="http://www.willus.com/k2pdfopt/" target="_blank">k2pdfopt</a>" to optimize the layout of articles and some of the functionality developed for <a href="http://www.zotero.org/" target="_blank">Zotero</a> to detect and parse journal websites.

<a class="anchor" id="q-about-compatiblereader"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-about-compatiblereader" href="#">Will Dontprint work with my e-reader?</a>
<div class="answer">
At the moment, Dontprint is compatible with all e-readers that can display PDF documents and receive documents by e-mail.
This includes most (if not all) models of the Amazon Kindle and also many other e-readers.
Future versions of Dontprint will also offer alternative options (other than e-mail) to transfer documents, such as transferring over a USB connection.
The developer of Dontprint is not affiliated with any e-reader manufacturer or retailer.
</div>

<a class="anchor" id="q-about-price"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-about-price" href="#">How much does using Dontprint cost?</a>
<div class="answer">
Dontprint is completely <strong>free of charge</strong>.
I originally wrote this add-on for my personal use when I realized that others might find it useful, too.
Currently, Dontprint does not display any advertising, although this might change with future versions.

<h2>Installation and preferences</h2>

<a class="anchor" id="q-setup-download"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-setup-download" href="#">Where can I get Dontprint?</a>
<div class="answer">
Click the link "Download for free" on the very top of this page.

<a class="anchor" id="q-setup-whygmail"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-setup-whygmail" href="#">Why do I need a Gmail account to use Dontprint?</a>
<div class="answer">
Dontprint sends documents to your e-reader by e-mail attachment.
These e-mails are sent from your Gmail account.
Dontprint takes your privacy serious and does <em>not</em> gain access to your e-mail inbox.
It requires you to grant access <em>only for sending</em> e-mails from your account.
See also: "<a href="#q-privacy-gmailaccess">Which level of access does Dontprint have to my Gmail account?</a>".
Dontprint uses your Gmail account only to send e-mails <a href="#q-privacy-abuse">to your e-reader</a> and only <a href="#q-privacy-spam">upon your explicit request</a>.
<p>
Using your Gmail account to send e-mails has <strong>two advantages:</strong>
First, it eliminates server costs, thereby allowing Dontprint to stay free of charge.
Second, it keeps <em>you</em> in control of all e-mails that are sent to your e-reader because you can <a href="#q-privacy-revoke">revoke the permission to send e-mails from your Gmail account</a> at any time.
<p>
<strong>If you do not have a Gmail account</strong> you can easily <a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?service=mail" target="_blank">set one up for free</a> to use with Dontprint.
You will receive instructions when you run Dontprint for the first time.
Please note that you don't even have to ever use this Gmail account yourself.
It is just used by Dontprint behind the scenes in order to send e-mails.
<p>
The developer of Dontprint is not affiliated with Google.

<a class="anchor" id="q-setup-ereaderaddress"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-setup-ereaderaddress" href="#">What is my e-readers e-mail address?</a>
<div class="answer">
Dontprint sends documents to your e-reader by e-mail.
<p>
<strong>If your e-reader is an Amazon Kindle</strong> then its e-mail address typically consists of a name that you chose when you bought the device followed by either of "@free.kindle.com", "@kindle.com" or "@kindle.cn".
If you can't remember which e-mail address you picked there are two ways to find it out:
<ol type="a">
<li>On the device itself, go to the home screen, press the menu key and select "Settings" or "Preferences".
Step through the settings like you would browse through the pages of a book until you find your Kindle's e-mail address.</li>
<li>Log into Amazon's <a href="http://website-g7g.amazon.co.uk/myk" target="_blank">"My Kindle" page</a>, go to "Manage my devices" and find the section "Send-to-Kindle E-Mail Settings" (see image).
<img src="amazon-screenshot2.png" class="screenshot" style="margin:0.5em 0 1.2em 0.5em;" width="486" height="101" alt="Screenshot: Where to find your Kindle's e-mail address on the Amazon web site"></li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>If your e-reader is is not an Amazon Kindle</strong> but supports receiving documents by e-mail then you probably had to pick an e-mail address when you bought the device or when you used it for the first time.
If you don't remember the e-mail address that is tied to your e-reader, look for it in the settings on the device itself or on the website of the company that sold the e-reader to you.
</div>

<a class="anchor" id="q-setup-approvedemail"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-setup-approvedemail" href="#">What is an "approved personal document e-mail"?</a>
<div class="answer">
If your e-reader is an Amazon Kindle then you have to tell Amazon that Dontprint is allowed to send documents to the device.
To do so, follow these steps:
<ol>
<img src="amazon-screenshot.png" class="screenshot" style="float:right;margin:0.4em 0px 1em 1em;" width="324" height="137" alt="Screenshot: list of approved personal document e-mails on the Amazon web site">
<li>go to Amazon's <a href="http://website-g7g.amazon.co.uk/myk#pdocSettings" target="_blank">"Manage Your Kindle"</a> page.</li>
<li>Find the section "Approved Personal Document E-mail List" (see image).</li>
<li>Dontprint sends e-mails from your Gmail account.
This means that you have to add <strong>your Gmail address</strong> (something of the form "<em>yourname</em>@gmail.com") to the list.</li>
</div>

<a class="anchor" id="q-setup-screensettings"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-setup-screensettings" href="#">What is the screen width, height and pixels per inch of my e-reader?</a>
<div class="answer">
Dontprint rearranges the layout of articles so that you can read them comfortably on your e-reader.
You get the best results if you tell Dontprint the exact size of your e-reader's screen.
Note that this is an "effective" screen size which is usually a bit smaller than the screen size that is specified by the manufacturer because most e-readers add some white margins around displayed PDF documents.
<p>
<strong>To find out your screen size</strong> choose "Tools &rarr; Dontprint &rarr; Configure Dontprint" from the Firefox menu.
Pick the "Device" tab and make sure the correct e-reader model is selected (or select "other" if your e-reader model is not in the list).
Then click the button labeled "Help me find out the correct document size".
<p>
<strong>The "pixels per inch"-value</strong> only influences the font size of the documents that will be sent to your e-reader.
Usually, it is best to set this to the recommended value.
If you find the font size too small, increase the "pixels per inch"-value.
If you find the font size too large, set "pixels per inch" to a smaller value.
</div>


<a class="anchor" id="privacy"></a>
<h2>Privacy</h2>

<a class="anchor" id="q-privacy-trust"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-privacy-trust" href="#">How can I be sure Dontprint does not secretly violate my privacy or abuse my e-mail account?</a>
<div class="answer">
The complete program code on which Dontprint runs is <a href="https://github.com/robamler/dontprint/" target="_blank">publicly available</a>.
This includes even the small part of Dontprint that runs on a webserver (and it can in fact be verified that the webserver runs exactly this code because it is implemented in a <a href="https://script.google.com/d/1kUxTN7tQapd67EmxXrXOgWgbT0wB-hse8sHo5BvTPUj-jez1KEfKJesW/edit" target="_blank">publicly readable Google Apps Script</a>).
Since everybody on the web can read and inspect the code that runs Dontprint it cannot include any hidden privacy violations.
</div>

<a class="anchor" id="q-privacy-gmail-username"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-privacy-gmail-username" href="#">Does Dontprint store my Google username or password?</a>
<div class="answer">
<strong>No.</strong>
Dontprint does not store any credentials (usernames or passwords).
In fact, Dontprint does not even know your Google username or password.
Even though you may have to enter these credentials when you run Dontprint, you're entering them directly into <em>Google's</em> login dialog and Dontprint does not intercept them.
For proof of this claim, see "<a href="#q-privacy-trust">How can I be sure Dontprint does not secretly violate my privacy or abuse my e-mail account?</a>".
<p>
<strong>However,</strong> depending on your Firefox configuration, Firefox itself might store passwords on your computer or even synchronize them between different devices you own.
This is completely independent of Dontprint and will happen even if you never installed Dontprint.
To configure the way Firefox deals with passwords, go to the "Security" tab in the Firefox preferences.
</div>

<a class="anchor" id="q-privacy-gmailaccess"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-privacy-gmailaccess" href="#">Which level of access does Dontprint have to my Gmail account?</a>
<div class="answer">
Dontprint has <strong>very limited</strong> access to your Gmail account.
The only operation that Dontprint can perform from your account is <strong>sending emails</strong>.
<p>
The first time you use Dontprint it will ask you for permission to send e-mails from your account.
If you don't actively grant this permission then Dontprint will gain no access to your Gmail account at all but then it won't be able to operate properly.
If you do grant the permission then Dontprint is allowed only to send e-mails from your account &mdash; and nothing else.
Dontprint <strong>cannot</strong> read, modify or delete e-mails in your inbox or access any other Google services in your name.
Most importantly, Dontprint <strong>never</strong> gets hold of your Google username or password.
Even though you may have to enter these credentials the first time you use Dontprint, you're entering them directly into <em>Google's</em> login dialog and Dontprint does not intercept them.
For proof of these claims, see "<a href="#q-privacy-trust">How can I be sure Dontprint does not secretly violate my privacy or abuse my e-mail account?</a>".
<p>
See also: "<a href="#q-setup-whygmail">Why do I need a Gmail account to use Dontprint?</a>"
</div>

<a class="anchor" id="q-privacy-spam"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-privacy-spam" href="#">Will Dontprint ever send any e-mails to my e-reader without my explicit request?</a>
<div class="answer">
<strong>No.</strong>
Dontprint only sends an e-mail to your e-reader each time you instruct it to send a specific document and it will not send any additional files other than the document you asked for.
For proof of this claim, see "<a href="#q-privacy-trust">How can I be sure Dontprint does not secretly violate my privacy or abuse my e-mail account?</a>".
</div>

<a class="anchor" id="q-privacy-abuse"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-privacy-abuse" href="#">Will Dontprint ever send any e-mails from my Gmail account to third parties?</a>
<div class="answer">
<strong>No.</strong>
You can specify two e-mail addresses in the preference dialog: The e-mail address that is tied to your e-reader and an optional second e-mail address to receive a copy of your dontprinted documents.
Dontprint uses your "...@gmail.com" address <em>only</em> to send an e-mail to these two addresses each time you instruct it to send a document.
For proof of this claim, see "<a href="#q-privacy-trust">How can I be sure Dontprint does not secretly violate my privacy or abuse my e-mail account?</a>".
</div>

<a class="anchor" id="q-privacy-gmail"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-privacy-gmail" href="#">Will Dontprint ever send any e-mails to my "...@gmail.com" address?</a>
<div class="answer">
<strong>No.</strong>
In fact, Dontprint does not even <em>know</em> your Gmail address.
Even though you have to enter your Google username and password the first time you run Dontprint, you're entering this confidential data directly into <em>Google's</em> login dialog.
Dontprint does not intercept your Google account name, password, or e-mail address.
Once you're signed in to your Google account you will be asked if you want to allow Dontprint to send e-mails from that account.
Sending e-mails from your account is the only permission for which Dontprint will ask you.
Therefore, this is also the only action that Dontprint will be able to do with your account once you granted the permission.
Other actions, such as retrieving your username or e-mail address cannot be performed by Dontprint because you didn't give it the necessary execution rights to do so.
For proof of the above claims, see "<a href="#q-privacy-trust">How can I be sure Dontprint does not secretly violate my privacy or abuse my e-mail account?</a>".
</div>

<a class="anchor" id="q-privacy-senddata"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-privacy-senddata" href="#">Which kind of data does Dontprint send from my computer?</a>
<div class="answer">
Dontprint <strong>never</strong> sends any usernames or passwords from your computer.
The only e-mail addresses that Dontprint ever sends from your computer are the address that is tied to your e-reader and, depending on your settings, an optional secondary address of your choice.
These e-mail addresses are used solely for the purpose of sending the e-mail and Dontprint does not store these addresses on the server once the e-mail is sent.
For proof of these claims, see "<a href="#q-privacy-trust">How can I be sure Dontprint does not secretly violate my privacy or abuse my e-mail account?</a>".
<p>
The following list explains <strong>all</strong> situations in which Dontprint sends any data from your computer.
<ul>
<li><strong>Retrieving articles from journal websites:</strong>
When you click on the Dontprint icon on the website of a journal Dontprint downloads the article's PDF file and some associated meta-data, such as the title of the article and the name of the journal.
To do so, Dontprint has to send some requests to the web-site of the journal.
These are similar to the requests that your web browser would usually send out if you downloaded the article manually.</li>
<li><strong>Sending documents by e-mail attachment:</strong>
Every time you instruct Dontprint to send a document to your e-reader it sends an e-mail to your e-readers e-mail address and &mdash; if you choose to do so in the settings &mdash; to a secondary address of your choice.
The e-mail contains a single attachment (the document you requested) along with some meta data about the article (such as its title).
The e-mail will not be sent to any recipients other than the ones you specify and it will not be stored by Dontprint once it is sent.
(A copy may reside in your personal Gmail outbox, though.)</li>
<li><strong>Voluntary anonymous reports of journal margins:</strong>
When you dontprint an article from a journal you may sometimes have to set the page margins manually because Dontprint does not yet know the correct margins for this specific journal.
Since this can be annoying, Dontprint provides to you the option to report the selected margins to its developer so that these settings can be built into future versions of Dontprint.
This data does <em>not</em> not contain any user-specific information (such as e-mail addresses or user names).
You can inspect the data before it is being sent and reject the transmission for each case individually.
You can also turn off this feature altogether on the "Advanced" tab of Dontprint's settings dialog.
</li>
<li><strong>Voluntary anonymous reports of device settings:</strong>
When you set the screen size of your device you can <em>voluntarily</em> choose to report those settings to the developer of Dontprint so that the default values for the screen settings can be updated in future versions of Dontprint.
The data will only be sent if you actively opt-in to do so and you can inspect the data before its transmission.
</li>
<li><strong>Software updates:</strong>
To update Dontprint and to download and update the third-party utility that rearranges the layout of the PDF files, Firefox needs to send normal HTTP requests to the web server.
The same requests would be sent from your computer if you downloaded the corresponding files manually.
</li>
</ul>
Future versions of Dontprint may contain features that bring along other scenarious where data is sent from your computer.
However, even future versions of Dontprint will <em>never</em> send any passwords from your computer without your explicit permission and will <em>never</em> send any e-mail addresses for reasons other than sending out e-mails you explicitly requested.
</div>

<a class="anchor" id="q-privacy-revoke"></a>
<a class="q" id="h-privacy-revoke" href="#">I'm no longer using Dontprint. Can I revoke the permission to send e-mails from my Gmail account that I granted to Dontprint?</a>
<div class="answer">
<strong>Yes.</strong>
You can revoke the permission on the <a href="https://accounts.google.com/IssuedAuthSubTokens?service=mail" target="_blank">authorization settings page of your Google account</a>.
If you ever want to use Dontprint again, that's no problem.
The next time you instruct Dontprint to send an article you will be asked to re-grant the permission.
