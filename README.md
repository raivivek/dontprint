Dontprint
===============================

Dontprint is going to be an add-on for Firefox.
It is currently still in development but you can already install a <a href="http://robamler.github.com/dontprint/">beta version</a>.
Dontprint allows scientists to send literature to their e-reader (e.g. Amazon Kindle) in an optimized layout directly from the websites of many scientific journals and preprint servers.
Dontprint also integrates with the [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) literature database, if Zotero is installed.
