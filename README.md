Dontprint
===============================

Dontprint is a free add-on for Firefox.
To install the add-on, go to [dontprint.net](http://dontprint.net/).
Dontprint allows scientists to send literature to their e-reader (e.g. Amazon Kindle) in an optimized layout directly from the websites of many scientific journals and preprint servers.
Dontprint also integrates with the [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) literature database, if Zotero is installed.
