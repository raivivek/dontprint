Dontprint
===============================

What's This?
-------------------------------

Dontprint is going to be a plugin for the [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) literature database. It is currently in development.

Dontprint will make it easy to send optimized versions of articles from your Zotero database directly to your e-book reader, e.g., the Amazon Kindle. With only one click, Dontprint finds the PDF file of an article, reformats it to optimize for the e-book reader's screen size, and sends it to the device.

Here's a more verbose list of planned features:

* Rearrange text flow to optimize for the e-book reader's screen size (using willus.com's awesome [K2pdfopt](http://www.willus.com/k2pdfopt/) utility). This works great even with multi-column pages that include figures and equations.
* Automatically cut off page headers and footers before the conversion. These would otherwise appear at random positions in the re-flowed output pages. Dontprint will infer the correct margins based on the journal name, or provide a graphical tool for you to set the margins if the journal is unknown.
* Optionally, send the optimized PDF document to your Amazon Kindle's email address. For other e-book readers, Dontprint will place the output PDF in a directory of your choice.


Current Status
-------------------------------

This is just some small gadged I'm writing in my spare time. I'll probably publish a first usable version on addons.mozilla.org in Q2 2013. Please drop me a note if you would like to get involved. You find my contact information at http://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/~rbamler/.
